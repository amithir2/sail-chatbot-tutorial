## Course Details 
**Instructor:** Chamila Amithirigala, **Date:** April 9, 2016


#### Goal
Show participants how to build a basic chatbot, and teach them about writing regular expressions along the way.

#### Prerequisites
Only mandatory requirement is ability to read and write English. Ability to check out code from Github and run a Python script (from the terminal) is optional, but recommended.

#### Materials
Need a lab with computers that have Python2 or Python3, and Git.

#### Course Outline
- 00-05: Introduce self, introduce to neighbor
- 05-15: Explain motivation, specifically Eliza, and why people easily believed she was human.
Explain basics of regular expressions, and why/how they are used in chatbots.
- 15-25: Students log on to computers, open terminal and check out this repo from Github. Repo contains simplified Eliza chatbot template, a file containing basic regular expression examples, and this README. Show them how to run the chatbot, and where they need to make changes.
- 25-40: Have students work on their own chatbot. Walk around and help if needed. Do brief explanation on reflections (this is something specific to chatbot implementation on NLTK) if needed.
- 40-50: Have students share chatbots amongst each other; have each student have a conversation with at least one other student's chatbot. Reflect on what we learned.
